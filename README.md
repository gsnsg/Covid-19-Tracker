# Covid-19-Tracker
An iOS app which shows Covid-19 cases per country and also has pull to refresh and search option. UI design was taken from [Swapnil Dhol's app](https://github.com/SwapnanilDhol/CornonaTracker) and I had to redo all the backend because the API
used in Swapnil Project is not upto date.
